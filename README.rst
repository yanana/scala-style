Read It
=======

* online - http://davetron5000.github.com/scala-style
* PDF - http://davetron5000.github.com/scala-style/ScalaStyleGuide.pdf
 
Build It
========

Get Set Up
----------

* Sphinx - ``easy_install sphinx``
* github-tools - ``easy_install github-tools``
* LaTeX (specifically ``pdflatex``)

Make it
-------

* ``make html # open _build/html/index.html``
* ``make pdf # open _build/latex/ScalaStyleGuide.pdf``

Note if you are on Windows, there is a ``make.bat`` that allegedly does this, but I have no clue if it does.

Also note that the majority of the ``Makefile`` was generated by Sphinx.

Fork It
=======

* Make a clone
* Make some changes
* Push the changes
* Send me a pull request

Note that this document is still in flux, so I would recommend discussing your changes on 
``scala-user@listes.epfl.ch``  or ``scala@listes.epfl.ch`` to try get some community consensus
